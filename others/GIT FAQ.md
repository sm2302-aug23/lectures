GIT FAQ

1. What is the difference between private and public repositories? What privacy setting should I choose for my repositories?

By default, a private repo is one that only you have access to, while a public repo is one that anyone can view.

There are several cases where others can view your private repos:

- You invite collaborators to work on the repo;
- You are part of a team that has access to the repo;
- You are part of an organisation, whereby the admins of this organisation will always have access to any repo.

You should set your assignment repos to private. This will prevent anyone else from viewing your work and copying it. 

However, please note that when you publish a GitHub Page, the contents of the README will always be visible to the public, even if your repo remains private. Therefore, please practice proper README etiquette (see below).

2. Can teachers see the private repo? 

As we are utilising GitHub Classroom, your instructors are the admins and they will always be able to view your repos regardless of the privacy setting. 

3. Should I work from github desktop or github app? root directory of project folder.

In most instances it is much better to work using the GitHub Desktop app, rather than uploading the files individually to GitHub website. The GitHub Desktop app seamlessly tracks the changes of your local project folder, and you can commit changes using the app itself. This way, you can continue to work on your R or MATLAB files locally, and commit whenever you make changes. 

4. What is .gitignore?

There are certain files whose changes should not (or at least, need not) be tracked. These include auxiliary files or log files and the such. RStudio may sometimes create these (hidden) files and you may have discovered them (e.g. the .RProj.user folder).

Any unwanted files (to be tracked) can be added to the .gitignore file. By default this file is hidden so you should find out how to view hidden files on your particular OS. A text editor will also come in handy here (e.g. SublimeText).
